Hello!
======
I am a PhD student at Universitat Pompeu Fabra under the co-supervision of [Laia Mayol](https://www.upf.edu/web/laia-mayol/) and [Josep Quer](https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/Josep-Quer-Villanueva-131). I am interested in the field of semantics and pragmatics and their interfaces with syntax in Romance languages. My main research deals with verbal mood and its relation to commitments. I also work on obviation, exclamatives, and verum.

You can reach me at *name*.*surname*♠upf.edu by replacing *name* and *surname* with my name and surname and ♠ with @.

My surname is pronounced [buxt͡ʃɨk].
