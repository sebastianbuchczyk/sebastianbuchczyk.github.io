Hello!
======
I am a PhD student at Universitat Pompeu Fabra under the co-supervision of [Laia Mayol](https://www.upf.edu/web/laia-mayol/) and [Josep Quer](https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/Josep-Quer-Villanueva-131). I am interested in the field of semantics and pragmatics and their interfaces with syntax in Romance languages. My main research deals with the phenomenon of mood variability and its relation to distinct ontological objects, speech acts, and commitments. I also work on obviation and exclamatives.

You can reach me at *name*.*surname*♠upf.edu by replacing *name* and *surname* with my name and surname and ♠ with @.
