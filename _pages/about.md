Hello!
======
<p><div align="justify">I am a PhD student at Universitat Pompeu Fabra under the co-supervision of [Laia Mayol](https://www.upf.edu/web/laia-mayol/) and [Josep Quer](https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/Josep-Quer-Villanueva-131). I am interested in the field of semantics and pragmatics and their interfaces with syntax in Romance languages. My main research deals with verbal mood and its relation to commitments. I also work on obviation, exclamatives, and verum.</div></p>

You can reach me at *name*.*surname*@upf.edu by replacing *name* and *surname* with my name and surname.

My surname is pronounced [buxt͡ʃɨk].

News
======
- Our article on whether-exclamatives as a verum strategy, written with Sara Amido, was published in the special issue on verum in [Zeitschrift für Sprachwissenschaft](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/zfs-2023-2014/html)
- Together with [Josep Ausensi](https://sites.google.com/view/ausensijosep/), we will present some work in progress on what we call post-imperatives in Catalan and German at the GLiF seminar at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra on January 25th.
